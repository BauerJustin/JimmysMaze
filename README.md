# JimmysMaze
Maze game made by Justin Bauer and Owen Tinning during our Grade 11 Computer Science course during High School (Spring 2018). Programmed in Java using Eclipse.

## Run Instructions
Download and extract the [JimmysMaze.zip](https://github.com/justinbauer-1/JimmysMaze/blob/master/JimmysMaze.zip) folder and run the `JimmysMaze.jar` file to see the program in action (need to have a JDK installed). Alternatively, you can run the GameLoop.java file to start the program by your own means.

## Game
Purpose of game is to survive in a dark maze avoiding the monsters at all costs. Use the arrow keys to navigate the maze and see if you can find your way out before you run out of health.

## Building the Game
This game was made by Justin Bauer and Owen Tinning. We worked together to create the final version of the game. The game was built on the base code provided to us by our teacher which created the animated window and refreshed the graphics.

Justin focused on the creation of the map. He created the structure of the map in a csv file and configured the barriers. He chose the spawn location for the player and also created the game over effect. The black overlay that makes the maze seem dark, minimizing the view for the player was also done by Justin. He created the health mechanism and made it change colours as the players health went down.

Owen was responsible for the creation of the player and enemies. He created the textures for both these sprites and made them move and turn as seen during the game. The keyboard input allowing the user to control the player was coded by Owen as well. He also made an algorithm to spawn the enemies in the maze in random locations. Additionally, Owen added the audio that plays when the user dies.
